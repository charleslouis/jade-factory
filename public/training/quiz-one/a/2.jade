	h4 Design a spreadsheet that allows you to calculate the price to be quoted to anyone wanting to make a group booking at your hotel.

	h4 Set up the spreadsheet so that it :

	ul
		li Allows the arrival date,  date, number of nights and number of people in a group to be entered.
		
		li Calculates the departure date.
		
		li Assuming two people per room, calculates the number of rooms needed.

		li You have a standard price of 65 Euros per room per night on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and a standard rate of 50 Euros on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Note that the day of check-in determines the rate for the entire stay.  So if the group checks in on a Sunday and stays for four nights, then the rate each night is 65 Euros per room per night.

		li However larger groups are given a discountas follows:  Up to 10 rooms per night receives no discount, between 10 and 20 rooms per night receives a discount of 3% while if the booking is over 20, a discount of 5% is granted.
		
		li Use the spreadsheet to calculate the revenue from any potential booking.  Use appropriate data validation techniques to insure that this figure cannot be negative.

		li The hotel has 200 bedrooms. Show what proportion of the hotel would be filled by this particular group on a pie chart (Camembert)
