	p Create a flat file database to record daily sales levels for your restaurant.  For each date, it should record the food sales, the beverage sales and the other sales, as well as the number of employees who worked that day.    

	p Your database should automatically calculate the total sales for each date.  Where this figure is greater than the average of all the total sales already entered in the database, the entire record should be automatically coloured blue.  Where it less than or equal to this figure, the entire record should be coloured red. 

	p Your database should have appropriate field names and you should enter data from three or four days to make sure that it works properly. 	

	p In addition, your user wishes you to:

	ul
		li Design a button (including a macro / VBA) that will sort the database so that records with the highest total sales are shown first.  If total sales for two or more dates are the same, within this subgroup, records should be sorted in date order, with the most recent first. 

		li Design a button (including a macro / VBA) that allows the user to just display records for the past seven days. 

		li Design a button or buttons (including a macro / VBA) that will display only records where the beverage sales are higher than the food sales.   

		li On Sheet3, prepare a column chart that showing average total sales broken down by day of the week.  Thus your graph should have seven columns – one for each day of the week and each representing the average sales for that day from the records in the database. 

		li Create a custom function called = salesperemployee( ). This should divide a sales figure by the number of employees to tell you, on average, how much sales were generated by one employee (the formula is simple – sales / number of employees).  Demonstrate how to use this new function in the range A1 to A5 of sheet3.   

		li When ever the workbook is opened, a message box should be displayed welcoming the user to the application.  It should then zoom the screen size to 150%. 

		li Create a button that displays a custom Userform that allows data to be entered. This should have OK and Cancel buttons that work appropriately, as well as verify that a date is entered for the date field and numbers are entered for the other fields.  Place a command button on sheet 1 to open this userform.
