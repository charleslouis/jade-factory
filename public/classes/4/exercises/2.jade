		li Your ADR (Average Daily Rate) is $56.
		li Labour costs vary depending on the season.  In high season (April to September inclusive), your labour cost is $70,000 per month.  At other times, they are $30,000 per month.  Note that this may change at a later date, and thus you should incorporate some way of changing it  afterwards into your spreadsheet model.
		li Energy costs are estimated at 5% of revenue.
		li Administration expenses are fixed at $25,000 per month.
		li Each month, you must pay TVA of 20% on the previous months sales.
